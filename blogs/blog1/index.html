      <h1>Site is using Local Storage... and the blogs are back!</h1>
      <i>The blog for my website is now live! And also, we're no longer using cookies, but Local Storage now!</i>

      <p>Ah, feels so good to finally have the blogs back since my site's revamp in October of 2024? Damn.</p>
      <p>But anyhow, WE'RE BACK! And not only do we have the blogs back... but the site has moved from using browser cookies to Local Storage!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Wait wait... what's the difference between cookies and Local Storage?</h3>
      <p>Glad you asked! Well... if you're a web developer like me, you can just skip ahead to the next section.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So cookies and Local Storage, in a nutshell, both do the exact same thing. Being to save data on a website for future use. Be it settings, account information, etc.</p>
      <p>But the difference between the two is pretty major.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With cookies, you have to set when they will expire. In my website's case, I've set them to expire after 2 years. Which obviously is a lot of time from now.</p>
      <p>And they can also store about ~4KB of storage, and if that doesn't sound like anything to you, most images are bigger than 4KB.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With Local Storage however, they don't expire and actually can persist on the browser even if you close it. Which sounds like a good thing... and it is.</p>
      <p>And, Local Storage can store about ~5MB - ~10MB. If that makes no sense, a 6 minute MP3 can fit in that range! (If it's encoded in like 192KBPS)</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>But neither of them are secure so, be weary of that. But, not like my website stores any sensitive information.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="section2_blog1">So... are the blogs from the old site coming back?</h3>
      <p>Short answer? Nope.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Long answer? They probably won't ever come back on the main site, obviously you can view them on the <a href="https://tdrbot.github.io/archive">archive</a> since there I actually saved the older versions of the site. But they likely will <b>never</b> come back.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Can the "account system" and all my badges come back?</h3>
      <p>...nope.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>If you configured any settings on the site before I moved the site to using Local Storage, make sure to go to the site settings to reconfigure them! As there is no auto-migration system.</p>
      <p>Anyways, that's it! Cya later!!</p>
