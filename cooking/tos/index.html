      <h1>Terms of Service - DELTARUNE Cooking Minigame</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: whenever i decide to remember this exists</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This Discord activity is a fan-made minigame inspired by DELTARUNE, created by Toby Fox. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or owned by Toby Fox, Fangamer, or any related parties. It’s literally just a small fan project for fun.</p>
      <p>By using this activity, you agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a fan creation and not an official DELTARUNE release.</li>
        <li>TDRP is not responsible if you burn Kris, get a low score, or scream internally.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>If you can use Discord, you can use this activity.</p>
      <p>If Discord says no, then… Discord says no.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3. Use of the Activity</h2>
      <p>You may play the cooking game, attempt to get a high score, and enjoy it.</p>
      <p>You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pretend this is official DELTARUNE content</li>
        <li>Sue TDRP because you lost</li>
        <li>Use this activity for anything illegal, unhinged, or extremely cursed</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>4. Ownership</h2>
      <p>The DELTARUNE name, characters, music, and concepts belong to Toby Fox.</p>
      <p>The code for this activity was made by TDRP.</p>
      <p>The rights for the music are owned by Materia Collective.</p>
      <p>The bad jokes and horrible code inside it are also made by TDRP.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>This activity is provided “as is”, with no guarantees, promises, or warranties of any kind. It might work perfectly. It might explode. Who knows.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>6. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you need support, contact TDRP on Discord. (@tdrrp)</p>
      <p>I'll probably reply with something unhinged or otherwise out-of-pocket, but helpful.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Last Updated: same as above probably</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>This activity collects only the data Discord sends by default for any embedded activity or bot. This typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Discord user ID</li>
        <li>Your username/avatar</li>
        <li>Gameplay events necessary for scoring</li>
        <li>Error logs (if the activity breaks in half)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Though in actuality we don't store anything, as this activity doesn't utilize the Discord Activity SDK since they haven't made a Javascript version yet.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
      <p>We (don't) use this information solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the minigame function</li>
        <li>Track your score</li>
        <li>Prevent the activity from catching fire</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Seriously, neither the SDK, nor are any API calls are used whatsoever.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>User data is stored only in temporary memory while the activity is running.</p>
      <p>No long-term databases exist for this project.</p>
      <p>When you stop playing, the activity forgets everything like it has goldfish memory.</p>
      <br>
      <i>But still, nothing is stored...</i>
      <br>
      <h2>4. Third Parties</h2>
      <p>The activity runs on Discord, so Discord may process data according to their own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>This activity does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>
      <p>Discord requires users to be 13+ anyway, so that’s on them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Wait, this activity IS hosted here... It's on GitHub too, 'aight?</p>
      <br>
      <h2>6. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have privacy questions, DM TDRP.</p>
      <br>
      <p>No but really, this activity doesn't collect any data...</p>
      <br>
